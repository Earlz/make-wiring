make-wiring
===========

A copy of Arduino's wiring library with makefiles for easy building without the Arduino IDE

## Building

Go into the arduino folder to build the core Wiring library. I have everything configured for the popular atmega328p. You may need to adjust parameters in the makefile for different MCUs.

If you're unsure of the settings needed for your board/MCU, look in boards.txt for some clues.

Next, you can go into redbot and build the redbot library
